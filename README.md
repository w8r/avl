| Operation     | Average       | Worst case   |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------ |
| Space         | **O(n)**      | **O(n)**     |
| Search        | **O(log n)**  | **O(log n)** |
| Insert        | **O(log n)**  | **O(log n)** |
| Delete        | **O(log n)**  | **O(log n)** |


## Install

```shell
npm i -S avl
```

```js
import AVLTree from 'avl';
const tree = new AVLTree();
```

Or get it from CDN
```html
<script src="https://unpkg.com/avl"></script>
<script>
  var tree = new avl();
  ...
</script>
```

## API

* `new AVLTree([compare])`, where `compare` is optional comparison function
* `tree.insert(key:any, [data:any])` - Insert item
* `tree.remove(key:any)` - Remove item
* `tree.find(key):Node|Null` - Return node by its key
* `tree.contains(key):Boolean` - Whether a node with the given key is in the tree
* `tree.forEach(function(node) {...}):Tree` In-order traversal
* `tree.keys():Array<key>` - Returns the array of keys in order
* `tree.values():Array<*>` - Returns the array of data fields in order
* `tree.pop():Node` - Removes smallest node
* `tree.min():key` - Returns min key
* `tree.max():key` - Returns max key
* `tree.minNode():Node` - Returns the node with smallest key
* `tree.maxNode():Node` - Returns the node with highest key
* `tree.prev(node):Node` - Predecessor node
* `tree.next(node):Node` - Successor node
* `tree.load(keys:Array<*>, [values:Array<*>]):Tree` - Bulk-load items

## Example

```js
import Tree from 'avl';

const t = new Tree();
t.insert(5);
t.insert(-10);
t.insert(0);
t.insert(33);
t.insert(2);

console.log(t.keys()); // [-10, 0, 2, 5, 33]
console.log(t.size);   // 5
console.log(t.min());  // -10
console.log(t.max());  // -33

t.remove(0);
console.log(t.size);   // 4
```

## Benchmarks

```shell
npm run benchmark
```

```
Insert (x1000)
Bintrees x 3,742 ops/sec ±0.89% (90 runs sampled)
Functional red black tree x 1,880 ops/sec ±4.02% (78 runs sampled)
Google Closure library AVL x 622 ops/sec ±4.22% (81 runs sampled)
AVL (current) x 6,151 ops/sec ±8.50% (72 runs sampled)
- Fastest is AVL (current)

Random read (x1000)
Bintrees x 7,371 ops/sec ±2.69% (83 runs sampled)
Functional red black tree x 13,010 ops/sec ±2.93% (83 runs sampled)
Google Closure library AVL x 27.63 ops/sec ±1.04% (49 runs sampled)
AVL (current) x 12,921 ops/sec ±1.83% (86 runs sampled)
- Fastest is AVL (current)

Remove (x1000)
Bintrees x 106,837 ops/sec ±0.74% (86 runs sampled)
Functional red black tree x 25,368 ops/sec ±0.89% (88 runs sampled)
Google Closure library AVL x 31,719 ops/sec ±1.21% (89 runs sampled)
AVL (current) x 108,131 ops/sec ±0.70% (88 runs sampled)
- Fastest is AVL (current)
```

Adding google closure library to the benchmark is, of course, unfair, cause the
node.js version of it is not optimised by the compiler, but in this case it
plays the role of straight-forward robust implementation.
